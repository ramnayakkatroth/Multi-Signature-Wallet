# Multi-Signature-Wallet

 1.Regular transactions can be considered “single-signature transactions,” because the only one signature is from the owner of the    
    private key.
 2.But there are much more complex transfers that require the signatures from multiple people before transferring the funds. They 
    are called multi-signature addresses.
 3.Multisignature addresses are similar to joint bank accounts where more than one signature owner is required for the transactions 
    to be authorized
